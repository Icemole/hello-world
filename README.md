# hello-world
This is a test.
Hey buddy, I'm an engineer. That means I solve problems.
But not problems like, "what is beauty", because that would fall
within the purviews of your conundrums of philosophy.
I solve practical problems.
Like, how am I gonna stop some big mother hubber from tearing me
a new superfluous behind.
The answer? Build a gun.
And if that don't work,
build more gun.
Etc.
